This project was completed in 48 hours for NASA SpaceApps. It leverages **Large Language Models**, **Semantic Search**, and **Knowledge Graphs** to help scientists explore the vast amount of information generated by NASA's bioscience experiments. It visualizes all papers in the dataset and shows the chain of citations it builds upon and the series of references that follow it. We have normal and semantic search of the studies along with a number of AI tools aimed at enabling future research.

## Features

*   **Interactive Graph Visualization**: Explore the entire corpus of research as an interconnected citation network of papers.
*   **AI-Powered Summaries**: Get concise, AI-generated summaries for publications to quickly grasp their core findings.
*   **Dynamic Search & Exploration**: Search for specific topics and interactively interrogate the collection of studies.
*   **Identify Connections**: Discover how different experiments and results relate to one another, helping to identify areas of scientific consensus or disagreement.
*   **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean, collapsible **frosted-glass** interface designed to present complex information clearly.

## Tech Stack

This project is built with a modern web stack designed for interactivity and intelligence:

*   **Frontend**:
    *   **React**: For building a dynamic and responsive user interface.
    *   **TypeScript**: For robust, type-safe code.
*   **Backend & AI**:
    *   **Node.js**: As the server-side runtime.
    *   **Google Generative AI**: The core AI engine for processing text and generating insights from the publications.
